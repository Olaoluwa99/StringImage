# ImageID: Transform User IDs into Unique Profile Images

ImageID is an innovative Android library designed to simplify profile image generation for developers. By leveraging algorithms, ImageID transforms user-specific ID strings into visually distinct profile images, eliminating the need for traditional image storage methods. Prioritize user privacy, enhance app performance, and offer a personalized experience with ImageID.

## Features

- **Efficient Image Generation:** ImageID eliminates the need for storing individual profile pictures, significantly reducing storage requirements and enhancing app performance.
  
- **Privacy-Focused:** Personal images are not uploaded or stored, ensuring user data remains secure.

- **Customization Options:** Developers can tailor ImageID to fit their app's aesthetic preferences and branding guidelines, offering a personalized experience for users.

- **Scalable Solution:** ImageID is optimized for scalability, making it suitable for apps with varying user bases and usage patterns.

## How to Use

### Integration

1. Add the JitPack repository to your project's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
		repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
		repositories {
			mavenCentral()
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

2. Add the dependency to your project's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.Olaoluwa99:StringImage:1.0.0'
	}
```

3. Initialize ImageID in your app:

```kotlin
ImageID.initialize(context)
```

### Generating Profile Images

```kotlin
val userID = "user123"
val profileImage = ImageID.generateProfileImage(userID)
imageView.setImageBitmap(profileImage)
```

Replace `"user123"` with the actual user ID string.

## Use Cases

- **Social Media Platforms:** Enhance user privacy while maintaining a visually appealing interface with unique profile images on social networking apps.
  
- **Dating Apps:** Provide users with distinctive avatars without compromising their privacy or requiring photo uploads.

- **E-commerce Platforms:** Streamline user registration and enhance privacy by generating unique avatars for e-commerce customers.
